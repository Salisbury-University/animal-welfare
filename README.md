<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Welcome to the Salisbury Zoo's animal welfare project! This website was created to serve as a centralized database for the Salisbury Zoo's animal care. 

The Salisbury Zoo animal welfare management project is an important initiative that will help ensure that the zoo's animals receive the best possible care while taking away from the strain of manually inputting data into a spreadsheet by creating a website that manages data from welfare assessments of the animals includes the following aspects. 

In this project, these systems are utilized: 

- User management system (UM) 
- Digitized forms for recording pertinent information specific to the class or species of animal
  - Additional sections to write down notes or concerns
- Visualization software to allow zookeepers to view stylized data and trends
- Database to store the information



See <a href="#roadmap">Roadmap</a> for an in-depth look at the timeline of our goals for this project
