So the zoo will probably at some point update, add, or delete a form. As forms are the most important 
part of our data set and the only non-independent data set in terms of that importance we need to
make sure that the form data is properly archived. 
Options:
1. Leave the data to MariaDB as it auto "archives" the changes of everything within
2. We have archiveable forms tables; whenever a form is updated or deleted - the previous version 
	will head to the archived table. 
3. We add an archived element in the Form table of the db. This allows us to just check whether a
	form was archived. Deleting or modifying a table when there are already checkups that 
	contain that form id, the element will be toggled, and a new form will be made.

	This solution also provides the users to make archived tables active and reverse changes.
	For now we will say that the form cannot be deleted. If we need to, just have option for 
	archived forms to be deleted forever.

Option 3 seems to be the best option, but I will keep this here just incase.
