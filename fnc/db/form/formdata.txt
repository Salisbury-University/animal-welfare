Since I went with option 3. It would be best to follow the following scheduling notes when adding, deleting, or modifying
	the forms
Home Page:
	Forms:
		Add Form:
			Similar to EditForm but starts as a blank page, the add question only comes when you have added a
			section
		Mod Form: 
			EditForm Page: Shows you all of the sections and questions for the form.
				Using Jquery's sortable we allow the user to drag and drop sections making this whole 
				process alot easier - see drawup.png
		Del Form: Makes sure the form is allowed to be deleted - not required by any species.
			Changes that form is_archived value to true

None of these are actual pages, they are just functions
